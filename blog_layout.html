            <article><h2>2020 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport 400</h2>
            <P>The 2020 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport 400's crown jewel is its brawny engine: How does 400 horsepower sound to you? This compact luxury sedan offers thrilling handling and it comes with a lengthy, up-to-date list of standard equipment. Keep in mind, though, that it's less refined than others in this class, with more road noise and vibration. It also falls short when it comes to cabin design. Its interior looks distinctly low rent when compared with that of rival sedans. This Infiniti merits consideration if your top priority is performance, but we'd recommend that you check out competing models from BMW and Mercedes-Benz if you're seeking a well-rounded, polished package.
